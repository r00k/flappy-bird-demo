Why?

Show of hands, familiar with Clojure?

Our plan
  Flappy Bird in browser
  Not boring parts

Starting point
  Live reloading
    Change "start", speed, pillar height

How it works now
  Print current state in browser
  All app state in map, threaded through function pipeline

jump
  destructuring
  maps
  keywords

sine-wave
  js interop
  threading
  source maps
  live reloading

score
  threading

collision?
  conditionals
  some
  fn literals
  %

Not shown, but awesome:
  Browser-connected repl
  Type checking!
  Core.async


Downsides:
  Not self-hosting, requires java

Setup
  Windows in right places
  Open Crockford image
  Open gojs.html


Next time:
  Slightly more basic examples in repl
  Get repl eval in vim working
  Didn't get to score example, but if I had, would it have added much?
  Show memory usage in profiler
  Throw finished fns in different file
  Show source maps
